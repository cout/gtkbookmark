This is the GTK Bookmark Editor, version 0.08.

You can save and load Netscape bookmarks, and you can rearrange the bookmarks
between folders.  Support for adding new folders and for adding new bookmarks
has not yet been added.

To compile this program, you will need GTK >= 1.2.6, as well as libglade.  Both
of these are available from www.gtk.org (libglade is a link from the main
page).

This probably won't work with anything except for Netscape version 4.  If you
like this program, or you have any comments or suggestions, please contact me
at pbranna@clemson.edu.
